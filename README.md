# Climate Data Project – Waukesha County (2010–2024)

This project analyzes rainfall data from five weather stations across Waukesha County, WI, to investigate whether **the timing of the rainy season is shifting** over time — a trend potentially linked to climate change.

## Project Structure

├── analysis.ipynb ← Main Jupyter notebook
├── report.md ← Final report (Markdown format)
├── images/ ← Graphs and visualizations
├── data/ ← Cleaned CSV rainfall data
├── .gitignore ← Ignore settings for Git
└── README.md ← You're here!


## Key Questions

- Are rainy seasons arriving later over the years?
- Which months and seasons have the highest or most variable rainfall?
- How might shifting rainfall patterns impact agriculture and planning?

## How to Run

1. Open `Jup P3.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells to load and analyze the rainfall dataset.
3. All plots are saved in the `images/` folder and used in the report.

## Report

The full write-up is in `Project3 Report.md`, including five annotated figures and interpretation.

## Insights

- Summer is still the wettest season, but late-summer and early-fall (Aug–Sept) rainfall has become more frequent.
- Peak rainfall months have shifted **from June to later months**, with a clear upward trend.
- This change has potential implications for **agriculture, stormwater planning**, and **climate resilience** in Waukesha County.
